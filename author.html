						I worked in the corporate world for over twenty years in various industries including publishing, marketing, technology and even aerospace. I received my paralegal degree in 1992 but didn't pursue a career. In 1995, motherhood changed everything and brought about unexpected, but amazing opportunities.
					</p>
					<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
						Being a natural-born entrepreneur who loves to create things, I discovered a new type of creativity after having a child. Before long, I was writing children's stories, poetry, articles, keeping a daily journal for our son, and spending hours doing crafts with him.
					</p>
					<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
						In 2002, the first
						<text class="brand">Guess What</text> story was finished but it sat patiently waiting in my computer along with other ideas and manuscripts while I enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom.
					</p>
					<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
						In 2005, I helped our son become an entrepreneur and manage his business,
						<a href="http://www.pencilbugs.com" rel="noopener">Pencil Bugs</a>. More ideas and stories followed but my first priority was our son. When he decided to "retire" from his business in 2011 at sixteen, I had time to bring my
						<text class="brand">Guess What</text> stories to life.
					</p>
					<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
						In 2015, I took a big leap of faith and decided to try writing an adult fiction. The romantic suspense,
						<text class="book-title">Her Way Out</text>, was released in November, 2016. It is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Her-Way-Out/dp/1537090569" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>. If you'd like to check out my other books, please visit my author page on

						I currently live in California with my husband. Our son is a software engineer. In addition to publishing, I enjoy painting and anything creative.
