						I worked in the corporate world for over twenty years in various industries including publishing, marketing, technology and even aerospace. I received my paralegal degree in 1992 but didn't pursue a career. In 1995, motherhood changed everything and brought about unexpected, but amazing opportunities.

					<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
						Being a natural-born entrepreneur who loves to create things, I discovered a new type of creativity after having a child. Before long, I was writing children's stories, poetry, articles, keeping a daily journal for our son, and spending hours doing crafts with him.

						In 2002, the first
						<text class="brand">Guess What</text> story was finished but it sat patiently waiting in my computer along with other ideas and manuscripts while I enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom.

					<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
						In addition to writing, I enjoy painting and anything creative.
