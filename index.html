				<text class="brand">Guess What</text> picture books are designed for children ages three and older. Each book in the series includes simple, yet clever, four-line rhyming clues that describe people, places, and things within a specific theme. Little known facts and many familiar ones lead children on a fun guessing game and learning experience. After the child listens to or reads the clues, turning the page reveals a colorful illustration of the object which lets them know if they guessed correctly.
			</p>
			<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
				Each book features illustrations done by Kids Around the World whose artwork was selected through a worldwide contest. The contests were open to children ages 5-17. A list of the winning illustrators for each book can be found on the Illustrators tab.
			</p>
			<p class="item item-full-width inset-sm">
				The combination of the rhyming clues and illustrations by talented, young artists is what makes these books so unique.
