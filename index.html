                <text class="brand">Then What</text> books are full of imagination and silliness where wacky animal adventures come alive and anything is
                possible. The repeating <i>If-Then</i> rhyming format helps young children recognize patterns and gives the opportunity to use predictive skills
                to guess what happens if... Colorful, playful--and yes--totally silly illustrations enhance these books. Look for more books in this series.

                    <text class="brand">Guess What</text> books are written in four-line rhyming clues that describe people, places, and things within a
                    specific theme. Little-known facts and many familiar ones lead children on a fun guessing game and learning experience. After the child
                    listens to or reads the clues, turning the page reveals a colorful illustration of the object which lets them know if they guessed
                    correctly.

                    Each book features illustrations done by <i>Kids Around the World</i> whose artwork was selected through a worldwide contest. The contests
                    were open to children ages 5-17. A list of the winning illustrators for each book can be found on the Illustrators tab and inside each book.
