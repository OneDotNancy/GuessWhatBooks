					Our privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

				<div class="qa-cell">

						Do we use 'cookies?'
					</text>
					<text class="qa-a">
						Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. Any cookies on my website are used to ensure normal website functions. However, these identifiers do not store any personal data.
						<br>
						<br>
						You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

						Third-party disclosure
					</text>
					<text class="qa-a">
						We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it’s release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety.
						<br><br>
						However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

						California Online Privacy Protection Act
					</text>
					<text class="qa-a">
						CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
						<br>
						According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
						<ul>
						<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
						<li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the bottom of each page.</li>
						<li>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes.</li>
						</ul>
					</text>
				</div>

				<div class="qa-cell">
					<text class="qa-q">
						Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
					</text>
					<text class="qa-a">
						It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking.
						<br><br>
						COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
						<br><br>
						When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
						<br><br>
						We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
						<br><br>
						If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website. If you are a parent and you have questions regarding our data collection practices, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this Statement of Privacy.

						Fair Information Practices
					</text>
					<text class="qa-a">
						The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
						<br><br>
						In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
						<br><br>
						We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days
						<br><br>
						We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

						CAN SPAM Act
					</text>
					<text class="qa-a">
						The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

						We only collect your email address in order to respond to inquiries. We do not have a subscribe option so you will not receive any communication from us unless you send an email and need a response.

We will never sell or share any of that information with anyone and guard your privacy as much as we protect our own.
